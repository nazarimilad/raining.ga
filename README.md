# raining.ga

This is the source code of raining.ga, a simple website which plays rain sound when the cloud picture is clicked. The sound can be stopped by clicking the cloud again. 

After being loaded for the first time, the page can also be used offline thanks to the implemented service worker which stores the necessary files as cache memory.
